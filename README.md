# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying suspicious or potentially fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. Using classification models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), this system analyzes transaction patterns to detect anomalies. The model was trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and aims to improve fraud detection in financial transactions.

Key Features

 • Data Cleaning: Removed missing values and standardized data for better model performance.
 • Modeling: Employed an SVM model with radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
 • Evaluation: Measured performance with F1-score, Jaccard score, and confusion matrix visualization.
